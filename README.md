This project demonstrates basic image processing operations on a sample photograph. It includes the original image, a resized version, a grayscale conversion, a cropped section highlighting a small area of the scene, and an additional image containing simple text on a solid background. Together, these files illustrate common image transformations such as resizing, color space conversion, cropping, and text rendering.
