# Image Transformation Examples

This repository demonstrates basic image processing operations using a single source image and a few derived outputs.

**Original Image**

The starting point is a color photograph of a mountain lake with reflections.

**Resized Image**

The original image scaled to a different resolution while preserving its content.

**Grayscale Conversion**

The same scene converted to grayscale to remove color information and emphasize contrast.

**Cropped Image**

A small cropped section of the original image, focusing on a specific area.

**Text Image**

A separate image containing simple text rendered on a solid background.

Purpose:
These images illustrate common image processing tasks such as resizing, grayscale conversion, cropping, and text rendering, often used in computer vision and image analysis workflows.
